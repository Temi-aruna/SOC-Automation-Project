# SOC Automation Lab for Incident Detection and Response

## Objective
This SOC Automation Lab project is all about creating a hands-on, cloud-based SOC environment for incident detection, case management, and automated response. The goal is to simulate real-world SOC workflows, from log ingestion and alert generation to automated response actions, helping to develop my practical cybersecurity skills.


### Skills Learned

- SIEM & XDR Integration - Configuring Wazuh for log collection, correlation, and threat detection.
- SOAR Implementation - Automating security workflows using Shuffle for rapid responses.
- Case Management - Using TheHive for tracking, analyzing, and managing security incidents.
- Threat Simulation & Detection - Generating security telemetry and analyzing alerts.
- Incident Response & Automation - Implementing playbooks for threat identification, containment, and eradication.

### Tools Used

- Wazuh - SIEM & XDR for log analysis, threat detection, and security monitoring.
- TheHive â€“ Case management system for tracking security incidents and investigations.
- Shuffle - SOAR platform for automating SOC workflows and response actions.
- Cloud Services - Hosting hte lab environment for accessibility and scalability.
- Windows & Linux Endpoints - Generating attack telemetry and testing security configurations.
